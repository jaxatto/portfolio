        <p>I design accessible, scalable experiences that make complex tools feel straightforward. My work spans fintech, internal tools, and enterprise platforms, with a focus on making complex workflows easier to navigate. I'm currently at ServiceNow, where I help internal teams design and build tools that are practical, intuitive, and easy to maintain.</p>

        <p>I lead projects from beginning to end, from shaping the problem to shipping the solution. By staying close to the details, I ensure accessibility and consistency at every step.</p>
        <p>I'm at my best in collaborative, technical environments, partnering closely with engineers to sweat the details but also keep projects moving quickly. My code background and experience with AI tools help teams stay unblocked, while mentoring designers and contributing to system-level patterns helps us scale good decisions.</p>

        <p>I live in Fort Worth, Texas with my partner and our four pets (our cat Midna insists she is the project manager). I love narrative-heavy games, deep dives into Zelda timelines, and finding ways to improve workflows that make other people's jobs easier.</p>
